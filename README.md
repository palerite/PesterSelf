# PesterSelf
A handy tool for sending annoying/supportive messages to your future self.

This app is for you if the idea of texting yourself through time sounds as extremely cool to you as it does to me. What can't you do using this! Remind future you about some embarassing thing they did, or do it accidentally not realizing it is embarassing! Tell them about what is important to you now! Congratulate them on some occasion! Tell them they matter and that people care abouth them! What are they going to do about it, reply?

# About
PesterSelf is an app that allows you to write messages(in the form of text files on your hard drive) and set these messages to be received at some point in the future - and then, when the time comes, it sends you these messages as notification pop-ups.

I used to do that through the calendar app on my phone but after "sending a message" this way into 2077 I realized that it's likely that I won't be using this calendar app so far away into the future. So I decided to make a tool for future-messaging using something more lasting - python and text files.


# Getting Started

## Windows

### Prerequisites
You just need python 3 and its standard library for PesterSelf to run: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Installation

- Run `Create Shortcut to Interface.vbs` and use the created shortcut to access the app.
## Linux

### Prerequisites
- You need python 3 and its standard library for PesterSelf to run: [https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html)
- Tkinter may not be included in your distribution, if that is the case, install it with `pip install tkinter`
### Installation
- Download the linux release from [the github page](https://github.com/palerite/PesterSelf/) and unpack the archive in a folder of your liking.
- Use `PesterSelfInterface.sh` to access the app

# Usage
PesterSelf consists of two parts - the **Interface**, used to interact with messages and set preferences, and the **Notification System**, used to deliver written messages. At no point should you interact with the **Notification System** directly, there are controls in the **Interface** to use it properly.
## Interface
In the interface, you will find messages that were already delivered, read and unread.

You can also write a message from here. After entering a title and a delivery date, PesterSelf will create a new correctly formatted text file and open it for you to write the body of the message.

You can open messages by clicking on them and delete by pressing the garbage bin icon. In *Settings* you'll find options for cutomizing the notification popup and an extremely important checkbox that adds the **Notification System** to the startup apps on your device. That way, you'll ensure that it is always running and messages reach you on time.

Also in the interface are controls for the **Notification System**. You can start or stop it from here, but I'd advise to keep it running at all times because you never know at what time past you wanted a message to reach present you.
## Notification System
As said above, **Notification System** is launched by either the interface or the startup script on your device. Please don't stop it manually(bypassing the interface). You can start it manually safely but why would you do that.

**Notification System** sends notifications to you in the lower-right corner of the screen. It only checks for new messages every 30 minutes(customizable in settings) so messages may take a slightly longer time to reach you if set to be delivered too soon.

# Acknowledgments
Homestuck's pesterchum was an obvious inspiration for the design. I used to send messages into the future long before I read the comic but the idea for this app specifically definetely appeared because of it.
